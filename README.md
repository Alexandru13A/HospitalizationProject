# HospitalizationProject
It is a project that I completed at the end of the course, is a desktop application that imitates a hospitalization system and allows us to enter patients into the database, administer a treatment and refer them to a doctor, and after that we can give them the total price of the hospitalization.
Is a project in which the following technologies were used:
-Java
-SQL (XAMP)
-JavaFX
